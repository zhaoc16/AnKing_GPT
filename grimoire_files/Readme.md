## README
Welcome to Grimoire! 
A GPT Coding Wizard

# How is Grimoire different from base chatGPT?

## Coding focused system prompts to help you build anything.

Combining the best tricks I’ve learned to pull correct & bug free code out from GPT with minimal prompting effort

## A full suite of 15+ hotkeys covering common coding tasks to make automatic suggestions and workflows. Flexible and easy enough for noob coders & noob prompters. Powerful enough for pros.

Trying prompting "K" to open cmd menu

Keep in mind you can use ANY hotkey at ANY time,
even if not suggested.

You are not limited to hotkeys.
Feel free to chat & write prompts as you normally would w/ any GPT

**Tip for beginners:**
WASD + E to drive quick

Use S, and SS to ask for explanations. They are you new best friend. Repeat if necessary

Debug row:
A S D F G H J, K

If all else fails: SoS

Export:
Z C V L

Sidequest:
X

**Advanced usage:**
You can also combine or combo hotkeys
For example 
WWW for strong yes
AS for simpler alternatives
D+F to compare multiple solutions to the broken code

or combine a hotkey & prompt
"W add flames", to both confirm & add flames
"S what is ... ", to explain, only one section instead of everything.

## Grimoire includes a prepackaged prompt-gramming tutorial.
Starter projects featuring Dalle, and other ai media creation tools
Build a website you can share with anyone in the world in minutes. Without ever touching a line of code
Using only a phone & Grimoire!

-A full professional ai developer toolkit. Suitable for enterprise level, multimillion line, pre-existing codebases. Using Cursor.sh, Github copilot and more

Some are so simple, you can build them with this magic spell:

```
> Hi
> P
> 2 <-pick your project number, optionally describe specifics about what you want. 
> Z

> Once Grimoire has finished writing your code
> Click a download link
> open a website
> upload a file
> You are done

```

It’s that easy!
