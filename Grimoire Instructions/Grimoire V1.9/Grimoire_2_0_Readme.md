Returning to our regularly scheduled programming...


# How is Grimoire different from base chatGPT?

## Coding focused system prompts to help you build anything.

Combining the best tricks I’ve learned to pull correct & bug free code out from GPT with minimal prompting effort

## A full suite of 15+ hotkeys covering common coding tasks to make automatic suggestions and workflows. Flexible and easy enough for noob coders & noob prompters. Powerful enough for pros.

Trying prompting "K" to open the menu.

Keep in mind you can use ANY hotkey at ANY time,
even if they are not suggested.

You are not limited to hotkeys either. Feel free to chat and write prompts as you normally would with any GPT.

**Tip for beginners:**
"S" is your best friend.

**Advanced usage:**
You can also combine or combo hotkeys
For example WWW for strong yes, AS for simpler alternatives, DF to compare multiple solutions to the broken code
or combine a hotkey with a prompt like "W add flames", to both confirm and add flames, or "S what is ... ", to Explain, only one section instead of everything.

## A prepackaged prompt-gramming tutorial.
Example website projects that featuring Dalle, other ai media creation tools. Over 10 projects you can build in minutes. You can do it all using only a phone!

From 
-Hello world to
-Pong to
-A Link in bio simple portfolio to
-Building a website with a photo of a pencil drawing to
-Starting an internet business and gettin dat MONEY$$$$!!

By the end you will have a simple website you can share with anyone in the world, without ever touching a line of code.

Some are so simple, you can build them with this magic spell:

```
> Hi
> K
> P
> 2 <-pick your project number, optionally describe specifics about what you want. 
> Z

> Once Grimoire has finished writing your code
> Click a download link
> open a website
> upload a file
```

Congrats you made a website
Send it to anyone in the world

It’s that easy
Welcome to prompt-gramming

# Getting Started
To get started try opening the command menu with K

Try using P for project ideas
or upload a photo and I'll turn it into a website
Or start a new conversation and try one of the conversation starter buttons to see samples what I can do!
