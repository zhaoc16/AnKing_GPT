I've tried lots of ai powered coding tools (prompts gpt, autogen, cursor, etc). I gotta say, this is the best I've seen so for initial prototype. I used it for enabling calendar sync in my app, and it's crazy how for it takes my first version

As a new coder, this is the best coding assistant I have used. I pay a few currently. The explanation command is magical.

I was skeptical vs regular gpt4 but the system prompting you’ve done, hot keys and approach to iterating on the idea all work really nicely together. Definitely speeding me up. Thank you!

Experimented with your autocoder on whimsical tasks, and I'm astounded by its exceptional performance. Usually, I brace for bugs and multiple iterations, but your code worked flawlessly on the first try. It’s intriguing why Code Interpreter couldn't achieve this.

My son is now using Grimoire to help with Lua scripts for Roblox Builder, and he says it’s WAY better at this than base ChatGPT.

Just generated a very simple game from a simple prompt. A couple of other prompts later, it added placehold graphics... This is quite impressive.
